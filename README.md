# EpiNet
A rich dataset called EpiNet consists of five network properties (features) and three epidemic variables (targets to Regression Chain Model for Predicting Epidemic Variables be predicted) for networks with varying sizes and average degrees. 

We generate 15K small networks (N ∈ [20K-60K]), 10K medium networks (N ∈ [60K-150K]), and 10K large networks (N ∈ [150K-300K]), with an equal number of instances belonging to three network families - Random, Small-world, and Community-based networks. We set average degrees for all generated networks in the range [6, 40], as observed in real-life social networks from the SNAP library. 

Based on the network sizes, we split EpiNet into  three partitions, corresponding to small networks (D-SN), medium networks (D-MN), and large networks (D-LN). The dataset can be used for further investigation by the research community.
